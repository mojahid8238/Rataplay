# 🎬 Rataplay


**Rataplay** is a premium, high-performance Terminal User Interface (TUI) for searching, playing, and downloading videos. Born from curiosity and inspired by [GopherTube](https://github.com/KrishnaSSH/GopherTube), it is built with Rust to provide a sleek, modern experience for media consumption directly from your terminal.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Fast Search**: Instant video search with live progress indicators.
- 🖼️ **Visual Excellence**: High-quality thumbnails with specialized support for Kitty and WezTerm graphics protocols.
- 📺 **Versatile Playback**:
  - **External**: Play videos in an external `mpv` window.
  - **In-Terminal**: Specialized "Watch in Terminal" mode using `mpv`'s TCT output.
  - **Audio Only**: Listen to streams without video to save bandwidth.
- 📥 **Background Downloads**: Select specific formats and download videos in the background while browsing.
- 🎛️ **Full Playback Control**: Play/Pause, Seek (5s/30s), and Progress tracking directly in the TUI via IPC sockets.
- ⚡ **Async Core**: Powered by Tokio for a responsive, non-blocking UI.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Rataplay relies on a few external tools for media handling:

1. **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)**: Required for metadata extraction and streaming URLs. (Rataplay performs an automatic update check on startup).
2. **[mpv](https://mpv.io/)**: Required for all playback features.
